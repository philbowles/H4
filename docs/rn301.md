# Release Notes v3.0.1

Summary:

* Some STM32 remnants removed, reboothooks etc removed, code tidied.
* Users should notice no diferences to their own code

## **REMOVED**

* STM32 features: in line with deprecation warnings for a long while now; finally got round to chopping out unnecessary bloat
* reboothooks / reboot chain (and example sketch to go with them)

The above toe fixes are based on the removal of all machine-dependent code into [PMB Tools](https://github.com/philbowles/pmbtools), leaving H4 to be concerned solely with the Queue and its timers.

Resonsibility for co-ordinatiing reboot/factory reset functions etc lies with any calling or sub-classing code.
